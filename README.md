# Manish_Calci2

This project is a modern calculator web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator allows users to perform all key arithmetic operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, exponentiation, parentheses, and decimal calculations. It includes clickable buttons for digits 0-9, all standard operators (+, -, ×, ÷, %, ^, ., (, ), =), and a clear/AC button. The interface is clean, readable, mobile-friendly, and visually intuitive with logical grouping, spacing, and color for different function keys. The calculator displays the full calculation history, current expression, and immediate calculated result. It also includes error handling for invalid input sequences, division by zero, overflow, and provides user feedback for mistakes. The app is responsive for desktop and mobile, with large tap targets and dynamic resizing. Optional features include memory and history functions, theme switching, and smooth user experience. The app works without registration, loads quickly, and gracefully handles accessibility needs such as keyboard navigation and screen reader labels.

## Setup

To use the calculator, simply download the HTML file and open it in any web browser. No additional setup is required.

## Usage

Use the clickable buttons to input numbers and operators, and click the equal button (=) to get the calculated result. The clear/AC button can be used to clear the input. The calculator supports all standard arithmetic operations and includes error handling for invalid inputs.

## Code Explanation

The HTML file includes all the necessary structure for the calculator interface, while the CSS file styles the elements for a modern and intuitive design. The JavaScript code handles the logic for performing arithmetic operations, handling user input, and displaying the results on the screen.
